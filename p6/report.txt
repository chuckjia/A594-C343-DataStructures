1. Naive algorithm is not as fast as the other two, because it only restarts by step 1.

2. KMP is fast when the alphabet is small and slow when the alphabet is large because of having more chance of
failure).

3. Boyer-Moore is fast when the alphabet is large, slow when the alphabet is small. This one works best for 
Twitter.


Analysis:

As we can see from the experiment results below, in searching English texts, Boyer-Moore always uses the 
lowest number of comparisons. 

But when the pattern is shorted or with fewer words, its advantage is not as much as with longer patterns. 
This is consistent with our analysis in 2 and 3. 

Naive algorithm always has the worst performance, as can be seen in the results.
