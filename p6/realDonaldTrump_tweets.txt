209.  Who was it that secretly said to Russian President, "Tell Vladimir that after the election I'll have more flexibility?" @foxandfriends
210.  Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? Can that be possible?
211.  Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me. Sad end to great show
212.  How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!
213.  I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!
214.  Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!
215.  Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.
216.  Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!
217.  The first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs......

237.  Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!
238.  For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately & fairly!
239.  The race for DNC Chairman was, of course, totally "rigged." Bernie's guy, like Bernie himself, never had a chance. Clinton demanded Perez!
240.  Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!
241.  I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!

274.  The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!
275.  FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!
276.  The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught!
277.  Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!

286.  Thank you to Eli Lake of The Bloomberg View - "The NSA & FBI...should not interfere in our politics...and is" Very serious situation for USA
287.  Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia
288.  This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.
289.  The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!

343.  The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources!
344.  I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!
345.  Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.

347.  Enjoy the #SuperBowl and then we continue: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
348.  I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!
349.  Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!

352.  Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
353.  Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision
354.  What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?
355.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
356.  After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!

358.  Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!

375.  Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq even after the U.S. has squandered three trillion dollars there. Obvious long ago!
376.  Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!
